### Project Description
CAL-MAT is a quirky twist on the classic calculator
‚Äî it listens for sounds and responds with unexpected answers, 
motivational quotes, or silly pranks instead of just plain numbers.
A perfect blend of math, mischief, and microphone magic!
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are tired of calculators giving the right answer every time.
There‚Äôs a severe lack of suspense, humor, and personality in everyday arithmetic.
The world desperately needs a calculator that listens, judges, 
and occasionally roasts the user before revealing ‚Äî or refusing ‚Äî the result.
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
CAL-MAT boldly solves this non-problem by turning
a simple calculation into a two-minute suspense thriller
‚Äî using your microphone to detect sounds, replacing answers
with motivational quotes, bad puns, or pure nonsense. Finally,
a calculator that prioritizes comedy over correctness!
## Technical Details
Built with HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript 
using the Web Audio API for microphone access and sound detection.
Features a safe math evaluator, prank/motivation logic, and runs fully client-side, hosted on GitHub Pages.
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- LANGUAGES-HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT
- NO FRAMEWORK USED
- LIBRARIES-NO
- TOOLS-VS Code ‚Äì Code editing
    Git & GitHub ‚Äì Version control and hosting
    GitHub Pages ‚Äì Deployment
